In my opionon <a href="https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice">Voice</a> by Paul Woitaschek is one of the best audiobook players for Android and has been my goto for a years (it has my glowing recommendation, so I wont be offended if you use it instead ðŸ˜‰).
While Voice is awesome, it was lacking in a very specific use case that I had. I wanted to use the chapter info that is embedded in OverDrive/Libby audiobooks, which no audiobook player has that feature built-in.
<br/>

I also have always wanted to learn Android development, so when the pandemic started (and me suddenly finding a lot of free time), I decided to build my own audiobook player that can scan OverDrive/Libby chapter tags.
<br/>

Fable was birthed from a personal desire to learn Android. In my opinion it has a pretty sleek design and is production ready.

Upcoming features:
<ul>
<li>Integration with offline sources (NextCloud)</li>
<li>eReader formats (epub, txt, etc) support</li>
<li>Syncing location between devices</li>
</ul>

Fable is also my portfolio for Android devlopment. From a techinical aspect, Fable is written fully in Kotlin, is built on ExoPlayer, utilizes RecyclerView, Material Design, and Coroutines.
